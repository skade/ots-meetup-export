The format of our October meetup will be:</p> <p><b>Scheduled talks</b> (~20mins each)</p> <p># A Coder's Life (So Far) by @stevenfarlie<br/>Join Steven as he recounts his life in code. From beginnings on a farm in rural Australia through to consulting in some of the country's biggest websites.</p> <p># Lists list lists by Leonhard<br/>Lists are everywhere: todos, recipes, plans, speech, programs, algorithms, Turing machines and even math can be expressed as lists. Leonhard will show you what the basic concept of a list is, how some well know subtypes (Arrays, Stacks, Double Linked Lists) work and what ready-to-use implementations programming languages offer. Furthermore we take an introductory look at algebra, set theory and predicate logic.</p> <p><b>Learn-n-Tell</b></p> <p>Inspired by Berlin's wonderful Hack-n-Tell (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell</a></a>), this is a chance for you to share with others what you have learned, what code you have written, some questions you have (there are no stupid questions!) or something you are stuck on. You don't have to prepare - all you need is 5 minutes. Bring your laptop - who knows - maybe there is something you have learned that is really helpful to others.</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before hand (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This is our fifth meetup, aimed at beginners learning to code and develop software. The format of the meetup will be:</p> <p><b>Scheduled talks</b> (20 mins each)</p> <p><b># The social side of programming \u2013 Giorgia Sambrotta</b></p> <p>Even developers love social networks - can you believe it? And it can also be funny. We'll see how to share code, discuss it and collaborate on thousands of different projects through Github, the social coding website. We will cover how Github can make it possible and the principal points it uses to make programming a social environment.</p> <p>Giorgia is a web designer working with Html/5, css/3, Sass and UX.<br/>She's really interested in programming and development and her goal at the moment is to learn how to program with JavaScript, as she finds it's a very important skill for the future work of a web designer.<br/>Giorgia is also a core member of OTS and sees it as a great chance to get in contact with a lot of interesting people and projects.</p> <p><b># An introduction to Arduino: the 5 Ws + 1 \u2013 Alessandro Contini</b></p> <p>We will try to answer to the following questions: What is it? Who did that? When? Where? Why is it like that? \u2026and, what can I do with it?</p> <p>In a time when everyone is talking about makers, digital fabrication, 3D printing, laser cutting, DIY and so on, let's go back and see where everything began. Ok, not EVERYTHING actually, but let's say where everything took a big step forward. We'll also have a hands-on demo that you can't miss, so \u2013 less talk, more rock!</p> <p>Alessandro is a tech savvy designer. He works with sounds, images and coding. After graduating in Computer Science and Music Technology in Milan he started collaborations with international companies such as Interaction Design Lab, Nokia, Eyebeam Art + Technology Center for the Arts, and taught classes at the Polytechnic Institute of Milan, NABA and Domus Academy. He's currently a Berlin based freelance creative technologist, interactive artist and regular hackathon-goer!</p> <p><b>Learn-n-Tell</b></p> <p>Inspired by Berlin's wonderful Hack-n-Tell (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell</a></a>), this is a chance for you to share with others what you have learned, what code you have written, some questions you have (there are no stupid questions!) or something you are stuck on. You don't have to prepare - all you need is 5 minutes. Bring your laptop - who knows - maybe there is something you have learned that is really helpful to others.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before hand (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards.</p>",

Then there will be a few presentations. StudioNAND <a href=\"http://www.nand.io\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.nand.io</a> will be on hand to speak on math/shapes in generative design using Processing. We will also have two other talks touching on topics of vectors, polar coordinates , linear transformation in 2D as well as a talk about the screen as a cartesian plane (coordinate system) covering basic 2D maths for visual programming. Finally, we'd like to have people creating their own geometric shapes and designs in the computer, so please bring your laptop with!</p> <p>This meetshop is aimed at beginners and designers who are interested in learning more about math as it relates to visual design.<br/>If you have anyway questions, please get in touch.<br/>We hope to see you all there!</p>",

What do people mean when they say X<br/>language is dynamic, or when they criticize/applaud language Y for being statically typed? Why do people care?</p> <p>While we're at it, what on earth is duck typing and monkey patching? What<br/>exactly is a \"scripting language\", how is it different to any other sort of<br/>language?</p> <p>Find out the answers to these questions are more!</p> <p>Emily is a developer who went from Java to Scala to Haskell. She used to work in finance, and about 2 years ago moved to focus more on web apps and start-ups. She likes making stuff for real people!</p> <p>Learn-n-Tell</p> <p>Inspired by Berlin's wonderful Hack-n-Tell (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell</a>), this is a chance for you to share with others what you have learned, what code you have written, some questions you have (there are no stupid questions!) or something you are stuck on. You don't have to prepare - all you need is 5 minutes. Bring your laptop - who knows - maybe there is something you have learned that is really helpful to others.</p> <p>Send us your ideas to team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before hand (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards. Look forward to seeing you!</p>",

    "description": "<p>First released in November 2007, the mobile operating system Android grew from a niche competitor to the dominating system used by a variety of device manufacturers and Google\u2019s most important products.</p> <p>As smartphone use rises, people are getting more more interested in apps and how they are created. Our one-day workshop for beginners aims to enable learners to create their very first Android app.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>What do we expect from learners?</p> <p>Interest and an open mind. <b>Prepare the machine</b> (see prerequisites) and <b>show up or free the seat</b>. <b>Basic programming knowledge.</b> We'll be dealing with basic Java and XML. Not knowing a programming language at all could hold you up too long and can result in frustration - we want to avoid that. \u00a0</p> <p>What can you expect from the workshop?</p> <p>You understand how Android apps are built, can program your first app and carry it home on your phone (or start on the emulator). As always with OpenTechSchool this is a hands-on workshop, not a lecture. You'll be working in very small groups and a coach will always be on your side if you need it.</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>Prerequisites</p> <p>Your own laptop running MacOS X (intel), Windows (x86/x64) or Linux (x86) with WIFI support Your own Android device is not needed but recommended. If you don't own one you can work with the emulator almost just as good. If <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/104166822/\">you'll attend the</a> <b><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/104166822/\">install party</a></b>, we will help you to set up your machine with the\u00a0necessary\u00a0tools. If you won't attend, you have to make sure you've installed:</p> <p>A downloaded version of the Android SDK for your system (<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\">download here</a>) Eclipse with Android Developer Tools (<a href=\"http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\">download here</a>) If you are using your own phone you have to make sure you can access the device through adb which often requires specific USB drivers. \u00a0</p> <p>Catering</p> <p>Our gracious host <a href=\"http://co-up.de/\">co.up</a> offers to buy drinks for 1,50 Euro each from the fridge against cash payment. As for food we can decide to go out for lunch or order in. You can also bring your own food, if you like.</p> <p>More seats? Yes, but...!</p> <p>We'd looove to offer more seats but the number of beginners is directly connected to the number of coaches we can find. <b>If you know Android please think about joining our coaches mailing list</b> (<a href=\"http://blog.opentechschool.org/2012/12/call-for-coaches-android.html\">below the call for coaches here</a>) and we'll add more seats to the workshop.</p> <p>Questions? No problem, we'll be glad to answer them. Just comment below!</p> <p>If you are confirmed (i.e. not on the waiting list) and you know you can't come please (!) free your seat for another learner. Thank you!</p> <p>\u00a0</p>",

Really! Designers, artists, coders, writers, game-designers, taxi-drivers, everyone! Don't worry if you never came to an OTS event before, we'll make presentations and the teams will form around a project and by affinity.</p> <p>But wait, there's more! The results of the Jam will have the chance to be presented to a larger audience at the OPEN END PARTY that will be held in the evening. No pressure though, you will show your work only if you want to, but we think it'll make a perfect finale to this unique event!</p> <p>Join and bring your friends!</p> <p>Please post a theme suggestion for the Jam in the comments. We will hold a voting session to chose the main themes at the beginning of the day.</p>",

And we'd like everyone to tag along. Whether you are working on your secret startup mobile app or just going through an online course to learn coding, feel free to come by and hang with us. And in case you are stuck or have a question, there are other coders around to talk stuff through with.</p> <p>Let the fun begin.</p> <p>PS: This is no workshop and it's not guaranteed we'll stay there all day but we'd be happy to meet you.</p>",

She is one of the organizers of this meetup!</p> <p><b>Presentation (~10 min)</b></p> <p># Berlin Mini Game Jam. Featured event \u2013 Iwan\u00a0Gabovitch @qubodup</p> <p>The Berlin Mini Game Jam is a relaxed monthly hackathon with a workshop approach. Attendees choose a theme together, form teams or go solo to make game concepts and prototypes on computers, phones, cardboard or physical space. Anyone from beginners to experienced coders and game designers is welcome. In this talk, Iwan will give a short walkthrough through a jam session and present some results from past jams. <b>Next jam: Saturday, 8th March at co.up!</b> <a href=\"http://www.berlinminijam.de/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.berlinminijam.de/</a></p> <p>Iwan has been an avid computer game player for most of his life and attending a game jam was the turning point for his involvement in the actual creation of games.He has been co-organizing the Berlin Mini Game Jam \u00a0since late 2010 in a team of three. He since worked on the independently developed game \"Nikki and the Robots\" and now creates sound effects for video games and other media. <a href=\"http://qubodup.net\" class=\"linkified\">http://qubodup.net</a></p> <p><b>Learn-n-Tell</b></p> <p>Inspired by Berlin's wonderful Hack-n-Tell (<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/berlin-hack-and-tell</a>), this is a chance for you to share with others what you have learned, what code you have written, some questions you have (there are no stupid questions!) or something you are stuck on.</p> <p><b>You don't have to prepare - all you need is 5 minutes</b>. Bring your laptop - who knows - maybe there is something you have learned that is really helpful to others.</p> <p>Do you already have in mind something to ask or present at the Learn'n'Tell session? If you write us before the Meetup, we'll be glad to reserve a spot for you in the Learn'n'Tell line-up. <b>Get in contact with us: team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</b>!</p> <p>\u00a0</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards. We are looking forward to seeing you!</p>",

Indeed, from the written word to the printed word to words on screen, the navigability of a text has always been a key consideration in a document\u2019s success. This meet-up presentation will detail a few aspects about how to approach typography in your projects. The points discussed will be offered with the reader or user in mind, and should be a helpful explanation for designers at any level.</p> <p>Diego Margini's talk:</p> <p>While creating flexible layouts is important, there's a whole lot more that goes into truly exceptional adaptive web experiences. This session will introduce the Principles of Adaptive Design: ubiquity, flexibility, performance, enhancement and future-friendliness. We need go beyond media queries in order to preserve the web's ubiquity and move it in a future-friendly direction.</p>",

As a beginner you get access to people who may be able to help you, and as a more experienced programmer you can share your expertise and train your mentoring skills by being a coach.</p> <p>The new format we will try:</p> <p>Welcome and introduction to coaches - what can you help someone with? 15 minute scheduled talk - the talks are aimed so that everyone can get something out of it, no matter what their level of experience or programming language. A \u201cmini barcamp\u201d - anyone can propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into discussion groups or pairs. At the end we get together as a group and summarised what we discussed. The scheduled talk will be:</p> <p>Testing, testing 123... with <b>Benjamin Kampmann</b> <i>How do developers test their code? What is a unit test? What other kinds of tests are there? What is test driven development? We'll give you an introduction!</i></p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm.

    "description": "<p>Last month we tried out our new format that works pretty well, so here we are again for another event where we can learn about programming together.</p> <p><i>New Format:</i></p> <p>Welcome and <b>introduction to coaches</b> - what can you help someone with? 15 minute scheduled <b>talk</b> - the talks are aimed so that everyone can get something out of it, no matter what their level of experience or programming language. A <b>\u201cmini barcamp\u201d</b> - anyone can propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into discussion groups or pairs. At the end we get together as a group and summarised what we discussed. Scheduled Talk:</p> <p><b>Text processing</b> <i>by Martin\u00a0Stadler</i></p> <p>Because is all about text data! How you can manipulate and filter that data? Martin will show us, also through live coding examples, what is encoding (and that \"utf-8\"?), search and replace strings, regular expressions (how to find and replace text patterns) and even more.</p> <p>Also:</p> <p><i>Stephan from</i> the\u00a0<b>Django User Group</b> will give us a short presentation about their next meeting and why is great for beginners to join it.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>The idea of the Learners Meetup is to have a monthly slot where we can rock up and</p> <p>hear talks which are on a level we can understand connect with other people learning tech to share knowledge, help and motivate each other Learners of all levels are welcome, especially absolute beginners. As a beginner you get access to people who may be able to help you, and as a more experienced programmer you can share your expertise and train your mentoring skills by being a coach.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards. We are looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>Ideas/questions?</p> <p>Email us at \u00a0<b>team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</b></p>",

What better way to cope with a flimsy sunlight than a friendly gathering with fellow creative coders?</p> <p><b>The Processing Code Jam is an open creative coding event</b> based on a simple idea: <b>build a project from scratch in a day</b>. It is a place to experiment, meet other coders, get creative, challenge yourself (and maybe even fail spectacularly!) It's all okay and there will be no pressure other than self-imposed: build it, show it, throw it!</p> <p>The way it works is we choose a theme for the day and make teams or go solo to build a generative, interactive or otherwise code-based prototypes. Some previous experience with Processing is recommended but <b>everyone can join! Designers, artists, coders, writers, game-designers, musicians, everyone! And don't be put off by the \u201cProcessing\u201d label; users of PureData, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, Touch Designer, and others are also very welcome.</b></p> <p><b>Bring your ideas, hardware, friends and some food</b> to keep you going during this whole day of relaxed (but intense) computational creativity. The jam will be followed by a presentation of the projects. Don't worry if you never came to an OTS event before, we'll make presentations and the teams will form around a project and by affinity.</p> <p>There's only one rule: \u201cIf this is your first time at the Processing Code Jam, you have to code!\u201d</p> <p><b>The event is free thanks to co.up coworking</b>. You can return their kindness by buying some of their 1.50\u20ac drinks!</p> <p>Note: <b>Please post a theme suggestion for the Jam in the comments</b>. We will hold a voting session to chose the main themes at the beginning of the day. In case you wonder what a theme looks like, here are the ones from the previous edition: \"the color of sound\", \"grasshoppers\" and \"time\".</p>",

    "description": "<p>It's never been easier to make video games, thanks to the multitude of resources available and a growing worldwide community willing to help beginners. As a result, new games are being released every day, exploring different directions and tackling novel themes: playing is more stimulating and inclusive than ever.</p> <p>Talk &amp; Play is a bi-monthly meetup whose goal is to give a better idea of what it's like to create and play games today, providing the opportunity to local independent game makers to showcase their work in a friendly and relaxed environment. Everybody's welcome, whatever their background and knowledge level. If you like video games, we'll make sure you have a good time!</p> <p>The event is split into two parts:</p> <p>1. TALK: a couple of short game-related talks, followed by a Q&amp;A session \u2013 it's all about sharing knowledge</p> <p>2. PLAY: games made by the speakers will be shown; in addition, all participants are welcome to bring games they've made or are still working on \u2013 a perfect opportunity to discover and play new games, collect feedback and maybe find collaborators too</p> <p>The speakers at Talk &amp; Play #1 will be:</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.tinytouchtales.com/\">Tinytouchtales</a></b> is a Berlin-based duo, which strives to create games and interactive stories for touch screen devices. In August 2012 Wiebke Rauers and Arnold Floeck teamed up with the desire to create their own projects apart from working in the film/animation and casual games business. So far they have released three iOS games and several prototypes for game jams such as Ludum Dare or the Global Game Jam. Their latest project is an interactive kids' book, which integrates games into a self written and fully illustrated story. Tinytouchtales is planning to go full-time indie at the beginning of 2014. They will talk about making games without a programmer.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://www.disastrid.net/\">S. Astrid Bin</a></b> is an artist and designer. She makes installations, performances, games, experiences, objects, sounds and images. She will present her game <a href=\"http://disastrid.net/panic.html\">Panic!</a>, an interactive story made with <a href=\"http://www.gimcrackd.com/etc/src/\">Twine</a>, a free and open source software, possibly the simplest game making tool available today.</p> <p>Talk &amp; Play is organised in collaboration with the monthly <a href=\"http://www.berlinminijam.de/\">Berlin Mini Game Jam</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amaze-festival.de/\">A MAZE.</a></p>",

    "description": "<p><i>New Format:</i></p> <p>Welcome and <b>introduction to coaches</b> - what can you help someone with? 15 minute scheduled <b>talk</b> - the talks are aimed so that everyone can get something out of it, no matter what their level of experience or programming language. A <b>\u201cmini barcamp\u201d</b> - anyone can propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into discussion groups or pairs. At the end we get together as a group and summarised what we discussed. Scheduled Talk:</p> <p><b>Learning techniques rather than technologies</b> <i>by Ellen Koenig</i></p> <p>In our software development jobs, we frequently find ourselves applying and polishing existing skills rather than expanding into new ones. Yet with technology always changing and developers being eternally curious, we need effective learning skills to master new subjects effectively. Psychologist have identified the principles of what it takes to master new skills: Challenge, clear goals, feedback, repetition, concentration. In this talk Ellen will show how these principles can be applied to learning different programming languages, frameworks and technologies as well as software development methods using examples for learning goals, feedback mechanism and repetition strategies.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>The idea of the Learners Meetup is to have a monthly slot where we can rock up and</p> <p>hear talks which are on a level we can understand connect with other people learning tech to share knowledge, help and motivate each other Learners of all levels are welcome, especially absolute beginners. As a beginner you get access to people who may be able to help you, and as a more experienced programmer you can share your expertise and train your mentoring skills by being a coach.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards. We are looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>Mini barcamp doesn't include any private room for group discussion nor projector. Is more about friendly discussion about what you are curious about with the tool we have right there. :)</p> <p>Ideas/questions?</p> <p>Email us at \u00a0<b>team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</b></p>",

    "description": "<p>Join us to make stories into interactive games using Twine, a free and open source interactive fiction tool. The event is designed as a mini game jam: the goal is for everyone to have a finished game available online by the end of the day.</p> <p><b>WHAT IS TWINE?</b></p> <p>Twine is a free tool for creating interactive fiction. It's gained notoriety because it enables people who are not programmers to make text games. It's simple to use and requires no programming skills \u2013 though if you're really interested it can be expanded using a little programming, but this isn't necessary.</p> <p><b>WHO IS THIS FOR?</b></p> <p>This event is for anyone who has an interest in games and stories. We're especially welcoming to people who are first-time game makers, as well as artists, designers and writers who may not have thought about making a game before. We also welcome experienced game designers and programmers. Twine is a simple-to-use tool, but developers can feel free to expand or extend it by using available modules, or writing their own (<a href=\"https://github.com/tweecode/twine\">GitHub repo</a>).</p> <p><b>WHY SHOULD I COME?</b></p> <p>A game jam is a great way to spend an afternoon with friendly people making and finishing something! You'll go through the whole process from concept to completion. You can work alone or in small groups, and you don't need any programming skills at all. We present themes at the beginning of the day that you can use to create a story, as well as some short talks that will tell you everything you need to know about using Twine and participating in a game jam. We'll also have people on hand to help with creative and technical questions.</p> <p><b>HOW'S THE EVENT STRUCTURED?</b></p> <p>1100: Doors<br/>1200: Short talks telling you everything you need to know about using Twine and getting things done on time<br/>1230: START JAMMING!<br/>1730: Upload your finished product<br/>1800: Presentations (open to everyone)</p> <p><b>WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT TWINE?</b></p> <p>Some Twine games you should try: <a href=\"http://astridbin.com/games/panic.html\">Panic!</a>, <a href=\"http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/howling%20dogs.html#2m\">Howling Dogs</a>, <a href=\"http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1104925/BK/brooklyntrashking.html\">Brooklyn Trash King</a>, <a href=\"http://www.lifeinneon.com/games/reset.html\">Reset</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theautumnalcity.org/Memorial.html\">Memorial</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://twinehub.weebly.com/resources.html\">A list of Twine resources</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2013/apr/10/anna-anthropy-twine-revolution\">An interesting article about the \"Twine revolution\"</a></p> <p>- - - - -</p> <p>This event is organised in collaboration with the monthly <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/game-developers-berlin/\">Berlin Mini Game Jam</a></p> <p>\u00a0</p>",

At the end we get together as a group and summarised what we discussed.</p> <p><b>Scheduled Talk:</b></p> <p>The magic of text encoding: How to safely handle \u00df\u00ea\u00f1\u015b\u00de and other funky characters - Dave Brotherstone</p> <p>Computers store everything as numbers - long rows of zeros and ones to be exact. So how do we get computers to store all the wonderful and funky characters of the various alphabets in this world? If you ever came across a non-English webpage or text document where all the \"special\" characters have been replaced by odd stuff like question marks or empty squares, you have experienced the practical difficulties in storing text as numerical representations. Dave will explain to us in a very simple way why that happens and how to avoid falling into this and other traps while working with text as a programmer.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>The idea of the Learners Meetup is to have a monthly slot where we can rock up and hear talks which are on a level we can understand,<br/>connect with other people learning tech to share knowledge, help and motivate each other.</p> <p>Learners of all levels are welcome, especially absolute beginners. As a beginner you get access to people who may be able to help you, and as a more experienced programmer you can share your expertise and train your mentoring skills by being a coach.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards. We are looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>The mini barcamp doesn't include any private room for group discussion nor projector. It is more about friendly discussion about what you are curious about with the tool we have right there. :)</p> <p>Ideas/questions?</p> <p><b>Email us at team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</b></p>",

We hope you enjoyed the sun.</p> <p>Processing Code Jam is usually an 8 hour collaborative creative coding event. However, this session will be a little different. We are organizing a more <b>relaxed Friday evening jam</b> and open discussion time. The usual whole day jams will resume in September.</p> <p>Since it's in the evening and in a condensed form, let's make it a <b>Show &amp; Tell stammtisch</b>! Bring <b>something to eat</b> and <b>a project you want to present</b>. It can be some prototype you've been working on, some interesting contributed library you found or even someone else's work you think is interesting. You can also submit an issue to the crowd we'll try to help you solve it. Of course, there will still be the option to seat and prototype a sketch for the duration of the event. Choose your adventure!</p> <p>Note: Co.up coworking is kindly hosting our event for free. You can return the favor by purchasing their fresh drinks for \u20ac1.50.</p>",

Now is the time to <b>start with our <a href=\"http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/\">Websites with Python Flask</a></b> workshop. We\u2019ll take you through creating a basic interactive website using <a href=\"http://flask.pocoo.org/\">Flask</a>, a very popular choice for websites created using the Python programming language.</p> <p>To make the most out of this workshop, you should already have a very basic understanding of Python, such as from our\u00a0<a href=\"http://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/index.html\">Introduction to programming with Python</a>\u00a0tutorial. If haven't done this yet, you can also come and work through that workshop instead.</p> <p>The learning materials are quite substantial for an evening session, so you might not finish all the exercises. But this is not a problem at all because you can go on at our new <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/dwwbjgyrmbmb/\">Continuous Python Learning Group</a> where coaches will be around to help.</p> <p><b>You will only need to bring your own laptop with a recent version of Python (2.6, 2.7 or 3.3+) installed</b>. If you have a recent Mac or Linux, it is pre-installed, so you are covered. If you are running Windows and need help setting up Python, please let the organizers know in advance.</p> <p><b>RSVP opens three weeks in advance on\u00a0Tuesday,\u00a0August 6th, 2013 at 6:30pm</b>.\u00a0Because the number of seats is limited, it is important that you only sign up if you definitely plan on coming (and do so, too!). If you can't make it for any reason, please cancel your attendance on Meetup right away so someone on the waiting list can take your place. Thanks!</p>",

Everybody's welcome, whatever their background and knowledge level. If you like video games, we'll make sure you have a good time!</p> <p>The event is split into two parts:</p> <p>1. TALK: 2/3 short game-related talks, followed by a Q&amp;A session \u2013 it's all about sharing knowledge.</p> <p>2. PLAY: games made or chosen by the speakers will be shown; in addition, all participants are welcome to bring games they've made or are still working on \u2013 a perfect opportunity to discover and play new games, collect feedback and maybe find collaborators.</p> <p>To give you a better idea, <b><a href=\"http://linkli.st/LorenzoPilia/5351I\">here's a recap of the first Talk &amp; Play</a></b>.</p> <p>The speakers at Talk &amp; Play #1 will be:</p> <p>\u2022 <b>Cay Kellinghusen</b>, founder and project manager of <b><a href=\"http://www.gamesciencecenter.de/\">Game Science Center</a></b>, an independent creative exhibition space slated to open in the next few months in Berlin.

    "description": "<p><b>Format:</b></p> <p>\u2022 Welcome and introduction to coaches - what can you help someone with?</p> <p>\u2022 15 minute scheduled talk - the talks are aimed so that everyone can get something out of it, no matter what their level of experience or programming language.</p> <p>\u2022 A \u201cmini barcamp\u201d - anyone can propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into discussion groups or pairs. At the end we get together as a group and summarised what we discussed.</p> <p><b>Scheduled Talk: Playing with the \"MVC\" concept (Ellen K\u00f6nig)</b><br/>The keyword \"MVC\" is tossed around all the time in different contexts when talking about web applications. Even if you know that the letters stand for \"Model-View-Controller\", that still is not very illuminating. Model, view and controller are builing blocks (or components) for a solution to the problem of keeping data (such as user inputs or products in a shop) and application state (such as: which users are logged in?) in sync between the user interface (e.g. the web page you see in a browser) and the backend (e.g. a database). So how do these three builing blocks work together to achieve this?`In this OTS learners meetup, we will explore this question together via a short and fun role-playing game. Join us and see from the inside what it \"feels\" like to be a model, view, controller or other essential part of a web framework!</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>The idea of the Learners Meetup is to have a monthly slot where we can rock up and hear talks which are on a level we can understand, connect with other people learning tech to share knowledge, help and motivate each other.</p> <p>Learners of all levels are welcome, especially absolute beginners. As a beginner you get access to people who may be able to help you, and as a more experienced programmer you can share your expertise and train your mentoring skills by being a coach.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm. We usually also have some drinks afterwards. We are looking forward to seeing you!</p> <p>The mini barcamp doesn't include any private room for group discussion nor projector. It is more about friendly discussion about what you are curious about with the tool we have right there. :)</p> <p><b>Ideas/questions?</b></p> <p><b>Email us at team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</b></p>",

    "description": "<p>Hello processors. Did we really skip two months? Some of us tackled new projects, some travelled, some made new friends, some enjoyed the sun... Now it's September already and your favorite creative coding gathering is back! What have you been up to this summer?</p> <p><b>The Processing Code Jam is an open, collaborative, creative coding event</b> based on a simple idea: <b>build a project from scratch in a day</b>. It is a place to experiment with procedurally generated art, meet other creators, and get inspired.</p> <p>We will start by voting for a theme for the day, do a bit of brainstorming then each of us will gather in teams or go solo to build a generative, interactive or otherwise code-based prototypes. At the end of the day, everyone gets the opportunity to show what they came up with during a short presentation.</p> <p>Bring your ideas, hardware, friends and some food to keep you going during this whole day of relaxed (but intense) computational creativity. The jam will be followed by a presentation of the projects. Don't worry if you never came to an OTS event before, we'll make presentations and the teams will form around a project and by affinity.</p> <p>Collaboration is great. The more cross-disciplinary, the better. Designers, musicians, artists, writers, game-designers, everyone can join! Don't be put off by the \u201cProcessing\u201d label either, users of PureData, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, Touch Designer, and others are also very welcome.</p> <p>Note to programmers: <b>This is not a Processing workshop</b> or a creative coding course. You will enjoy it more if you already have some basics skills in Processing or creative coding in general. However, beginners are very welcome and working in a team with more experienced coders can also be a great way to learn.</p> <p><b>The event is free thanks to co.up coworking</b>. You can return their kindness by buying some of their 1.50\u20ac drinks!</p> <p>Note: <b>Please post a theme suggestion for the Jam in the comments</b>. We will hold a voting session to chose the main themes at the beginning of the day.</p>",

You will enjoy it more.</i></p> <p><b>What is this event?</b><br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are encouraged to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?<br/></b> Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds.

Interesting books for inspiration, fancy hardware, quirky materials and snacks to share are also always a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Theme suggestion</b><br/>Please suggest a theme in the comments below. Themes can be random topics like \"beagles\", \"survival of the fattest\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"the source code should fit in a Tweet\" (wink wink <a href=\"http://funprogramming.org/p5tweets/\">Abe Pazos</a>) or inspirational quotes. I love this one from \"Famous New Media Artist\" <a href=\"http://jeremybailey.net/\">Jeremy Bailey</a>: \"I want to make things people eventually believe were inevitable but now seem utterly ridiculous.\"</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>Co.up coworking is kindly providing the space.

As a beginner you get access to people who may be able to help you, and as a more experienced programmer you can share your expertise and train your mentoring skills by being a coach.</p> <p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>We suggest you grab something to eat before the event (or bring it with you) as the evening tends to go on until around 9pm.

    "description": "<p><b>Important Note:</b> To sign-up for this meetup-- you must use <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/opentechschool-hardware-hacking-weekend-fundraiser-at-fab-lab-berlin-tickets-10056205381\">this Eventbrite link</a>!\u00a0<b>If you signed up previously on this meetup page-- it does not secure you a spot!</b></p> <p>Most of us are using a lot of devices. Mostly daily or more often. And once in a while a device becomes defective. A DVD-drive may fail due to age, the smartphone-screen may shiver, the battery starts to hold less and less energy, a button needs to be pressed harder every time before it stops working at all, the keyboard starts to become skittish after you spilled a caffeinated beverage on it, the contact of a connector may become unreliable, \u2026</p> <p>A few years ago, when people used mainly desktop computers, that was no big deal. You bought a new part end replaced it. Opening up a case was not complicated and most thinks were built to be replaced by the user or everyone who was a little curious.\u00a0But nowadays it is different. For several reasons. Devices have become smaller, lighter and more\u00a0functions\u00a0are stuffed into one case. Also, making things easy to repair lowers your profit as a company twice, because designing and building gets more expensive and if you can repair your device you will buy less new ones.</p> <p>Come if you just want to see, what a device is actually made of, if you want to learn how to open one yourself in a proper way or even how to repair your broken device.</p> <p><b>Bring yourself:</b><br/>Everyone is welcome. No experience or knowledge is needed. Almost everyone can do these things. Calm hands are good, so try to consume not to much (or enough if you are very addicted : )\u00a0caffeine\u00a0in advance. \u201eRummackern\u201c (= dominant behaviour, playing THE specialist, mansplaining, \u2026) will not be tolerated.</p> <p><b>Bring your own devices:</b><br/>Feel very free to bring your own devices. You can bring all kinds of devices. Smartphones, laptops, tablets, radios, monitors, \u2026<br/>If you want to repair it, ask here first, if you going to need a replacement part. Usually broken plastic can be glued, a broken digitizer (the touch-part of a touchscreen) must be replaced as well as a broken display (the monitor of a touchscreen) or old batteries. If needed, buy a replacement part (ebay is a good place, consider the shipping times!) and bring it with you. Parts are often cheap (a typical smartphone digitizer is around 15 Euro, a typical display between 15 and 30 Euro and both in one set between 30 and 50 Euro. A battery might cost around 10 Euro). If you do not know, what you need, just name your device and describe its defect here in the comment section.</p> <p><b>Bring your own tools:</b><br/>I do have some tools, but I will not have an indefinite number of them. If you have small screwdrivers, bring them with you. Bring as well small plastic things as a plectrum, a ruler or the SD-card dummy from your laptop. We will use them as spudges.

The motto is \"everybody is a learner\", so no matter what level you are on, this meetup invites you to follow your curiosity and explore new areas.</p> <p>The meetup features: Certified 100% jargon-free talks about tech fundamentals, learning and hacking, followed by discussions in small groups on your most burning questions related to these topics.\u00a0</p> <p><b>Agenda</b><br/>-----------</p> <p><b>Talk: AfricaHackTrip (ca. 15 mins)</b> \u2013 A few months ago a bunch of European hackers made a trip to Africa to explore the tech scene, to exchange, collaborate and connect the communities. We hosted Barcamps and Hackathons in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, met at least 400 tech people interested in topics like open-source, web development, community, mobile apps, UX\u2026 Community-driven education has also been a topic and we even founded the OTS Nairobi chapter! I\u2019d like to tell you a little bit about it. Maybe also about the crazy life you can lead as a \"hacker\" ;) <a href=\"http://africahacktrip.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://africahacktrip.org</a></p> <p><b>Martin</b> is a web developer focussing on frontend and user interfaces currently freelancing. He is co-organizing the OTS Learners Meetup, JavaScript workshops and JavaScript Learners Groups and thinks most of the apps around should be HTML5.</p> <p><b>Talk: Your first open source contribution (ca. 10 mins)</b> - Getting started with contributing to open source can<br/>seem very intimidating at first. This talk shows how to pick your first project and get started with contributing.</p> <p><b>Philipp</b> is a recent graduate from the <a href=\"http://www.hackership.org/\">OTS Hackership programme</a> where he has been focusing on learning about Ruby on Rails and Test Driven Development.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 45 mins)</b> - Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar.

    "description": "<p>It's never been easier to make video games, thanks to the multitude of resources available and a growing worldwide community willing to help beginners. As a result, new games are being released every day, exploring different directions and tackling novel themes: playing is more stimulating and inclusive than ever.</p> <p>Talk &amp; Play is a bi-monthly meetup whose goal is to give a better idea of what it's like to create and play games today, providing the opportunity to local independent game makers to showcase their work in a friendly and relaxed environment. Everybody's welcome, whatever their background and knowledge level. If you like video games, we'll make sure you have a good time!</p> <p>The event is split into two parts:</p> <p>1. TALK: 2/3 short game-related talks (5 to 15 minutes), followed by a Q&amp;A session \u2013 it's all about sharing knowledge.</p> <p>2. PLAY: games made or chosen by the speakers will be shown; in addition, all participants are welcome to bring games they've made or are still working on \u2013 a perfect opportunity to discover and play new games, collect feedback and maybe find collaborators.</p> <p>To give you a better idea of what you're going to find, check out the summaries of the previous Talk &amp; Play: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/talkandplay1\">#1</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/talkandplay2\">#2</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/talkandplay3\">#3</a>, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/talkandplay4\">#4</a>\u00a0</p> <p>The Talk &amp; Play #5 speakers will be:</p> <p>\u2014<b>\u00a0<a href=\"http://plopesresearch.net\">Pedro Lopes</a></b>, a PhD student of Prof. Patrick Baudisch's Human Computer Interaction lab in Hasso Plattner Institut, Berlin.

Now, interfaces and games became more immersive by requiring us to physically enact, such as with Wii or Kinect. With graphics and user interaction now part of many games, many researchers argue that haptics and motion are the next step towards increasing realism. However, when it comes to output, we have nothing more than vibrating buzzers, such as the ones that make our smartphones vibrate. In this talk, we show compelling new ultra-mobile technologies that provide exciting haptic feedback. Our approaches achieve a low hardware footprint by leveraging use our own muscle power! We will demonstrate several projects that allow for interaction to become more immersive.\u00a0</i>\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.hpi.uni-potsdam.de/baudisch/projects/muscle-propelled-force-feedback.html\"><b>More info</b></a> | <b><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swmGaGT8lvs\">Video preview</a></b></p> <p>\u2014\u00a0<b><a href=\"http://www.sjorshoukes.nl/\">Sjors Houkes</a></b> has supported starting game studios for years at <a href=\"http://www.dutchgamegarden.nl/\">Dutch Game Garden</a>, by organising network events, festivals and game jams.

All the hip devs do it. In the last ten years, the number of jams has risen to the amount that there's always a jam going on, whether online or local, and anyone is welcome to join. Lately, even scandals like the Candy trademark and Flappy Bird are popular jam material. But why? Why spend time with strangers, on projects that hardly ever get a release? What is the nature of a jam? And how can we use it to our advantage?

We hosted Barcamps and Hackathons in Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania, met at least 400 tech people interested in topics like open-source, web development, community, mobile apps, UX\u2026 Community-driven education has also been a topic and we even founded the OTS Nairobi chapter! I\u2019d like to tell you a little bit about it. Maybe also about the crazy life you can lead as a \"hacker\" ;) <a href=\"http://africahacktrip.org/\"><a href=\"http://africahacktrip.org\" class=\"linkified\">http://africahacktrip.org</a></a></p> <p><b>Martin</b> is a web developer focussing on frontend and user interfaces currently freelancing. He is co-organizing the OTS Learners Meetup, JavaScript workshops and JavaScript Learners Groups and thinks most of the apps around should be HTML5.</p> <p><b>Talk:</b> <b>\u201eAnatomy of a web request\u201c (ca. 15 mins)</b> - Did you ever wonder what happens after you entered a URL into your browser? This talk presents the anatomy of a web request. You'll learn what is sent to and received from the server, including such magical things like cookies and how this might effect your privacy.</p> <p><b>Andreas</b> is technical lead at Moccu, a digital agency based in Berlin. Most of the time he uses Python and Django to build backend systems for websites and web applications. He also likes to tweak the agency's workflow with various tools and techniques. At OpenTechSchool Andreas is mainly engaged in the Python group where he organizes workshops and contributes to the learning materials</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 45 mins)</b> - Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar.

    "description": "<p>In this workshop you will be introduced to the social side of coding. We will therefore use the most popular site for social programming: GitHub.<br/>The weapon of our choice will be Git, a Source Code Management (SCM) tool. This tool keeps a copy of every version of a file in your repository - wether it is code or an important paper.</p> <p>The course itself is going to have to parts. In the first part we will get you up and running with Git and GitHub. You will create a simple repository and get it on GitHub. During the second half we will show you some of the really neat things you can do with GitHub.<br/>We will welcome you to the Underground - a secret organisation planning world domination. Here you will help us to create a list of the best cafes, bars and restaurants around the globe. After all: Nobody wants to take over the world with an empty stomach.</p> <p>RSVPs will open on April 16, 2014 Wednesday. Unfortunately the Underground only can accommodate a limited number of people, so please keep the list up to date. We are still looking for people to help us coach. If you<br/>are interested in helping people get started with Git, please let us know with a posting in this discussion.

Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>What is Creative Coding?</b><br/>Creative coding is the art of expressing oneself through the medium of computation. Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds.

We don't expect you to be a full-time programmer, but you should know what variables,\u00a0loops and functions are,\u00a0and how to use them.\u00a0If you wanna refresh your\u00a0JavaScript skills, have a look here: \u00a0<a href=\"http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-4h-workshop-1/\"><a href=\"http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-4h-workshop-1/\" class=\"linkified\">http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-4h-workshop-1/</a></a></p> <p>During 2-3 hours on a Sunday afternoon, we'll get you set up with node, show you what node packages are and how to use them, and show you how to write a simple server application.\u00a0</p> <p><b>You'll need to bring</b> your own laptop for this course. Since node.js is a relatively short install, we can help you get set up (it runs on windows, mac and linux), but if you wanna come prepared, you can install it from\u00a0<a href=\"http://nodejs.org/download/\"><a href=\"http://nodejs.org/download/\" class=\"linkified\">http://nodejs.org/download/</a></a>\u00a0(use the installer, it takes about 5 minutes).</p> <p>The workshop is absolutely free, no charge, and there will be coaches speaking english, german and a bunch of other languages as well.\u00a0</p> <p>Because the number of seats is limited, it is important that you only sign up if you definitely plan on coming (and do so, too!). If you can't make it for any reason, please cancel your attendance on Meetup right away so your someone on the waiting list can take your place. Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you there!</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly collaborative computational art event. It is free and open to all, regardless of age, gender, or previous experience. Please read the following description before you join! You will enjoy it more.</p> <p><b>What is this event?</b>\u00a0<br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>What is Creative Coding?</b><br/>Creative coding is the art of expressing oneself through the medium of computation. Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds. If you are creative and like a bit of challenge, this one is for you.\u00a0</p> <p><b>What this event is not.</b><br/>The Creative Code Jam is not a lesson, a contest or a conference.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer or other computational weapon of choice. Interesting books for inspiration, fancy hardware, quirky materials and snacks to share are also always a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Theme suggestion</b><br/>Please suggest a theme in the comments below. Themes can be random topics like \"cake\", \"resilience\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"make a computational version of a non-digital artpiece\", or anything you can think of really.</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>co.up coworking<br/>Adalbertstr. 8<br/>10999 Berlin</p> <p>The place is a bit hard to find.\u00a0<br/>This should help:\u00a0<a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\"><a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\" class=\"linkified\">http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking</a></a></p> <p>Co.up coworking is kindly providing the space.

    "description": "<p>Talk &amp; Play is turning one! To celebrate the occasion, this meetup is going to be a bit different than usual: it will take place in a special location featuring a beautiful garden, and there will be a BBQ as well, weather permitting \u2013 we're going to provide some food but it would be nice if you could bring extra stuff (file under: BYOF).\u00a0<b>UPDATE: because of the rainy and cold weather there won't be any\u00a0BBQ, but the meetup is taking place anyway! Doors are at 6:30pm, Vescape\u2019s presentation will start around 7:30pm. There will be drinks &amp; snacks. Bring your games!</b></p> <p>This time there will be no talks, but\u00a0<b>Jerome\u00a0Feys\u00a0</b>and<b>\u00a0Jean-Baptiste Molle</b>, the two founders of the\u00a0<b><a href=\"http://www.vescape.com/\">VESCAPE</a></b>\u00a0game studio headquartered in the Blue Factory, are going to showcase their new concept. They develop interactive video games for fitness equipment like exercise bikes. Their first game,\u00a0<b>Vescape Cycle Racing</b>, is a cycle racing game where the avatar bikes at the exact same speed as the player\u00a0and the pedaling resistance changes automatically according to the slope, making it for example much harder to bike uphill. They will also present other games like\u00a0<b>Django Kart</b>, a go-kart racing game, and some maze games as well as the possibilities for game developers to offer their own concepts and games on their platform.</p> <p>As always, all participants are welcome to bring games they've made or are still working on \u2013 a perfect opportunity to discover and play new games, collect feedback and, who knows?, maybe find collaborators for future projects.\u00a0</p> <p>If you've never been to Talk &amp; Play before, check out the <a href=\"http://linkli.st/LorenzoPilia/8WTOT\"><b>summaries of the previous events</b></a> to get a better idea of what we talk about when we talk about video games.</p> <p>Would you like to give a talk in the future?

Unlike other visual tools that rely on having a computer attached at all times, a MicroFlo program runs standalone in the microcontroller.</p> <p>MicroFlo uses Flowhub.io as its IDE. Flowhub can also be used to program JavaScript for browser and server.</p> <p>Introduction: 2-3 hours</p> <p>Background<br/>- Core programming concepts<br/>- Working with digital and analog I/O<br/>- More complex I/O components: Temperature, LEDs, etc<br/>- Adding new components<br/>- Communicating with a computer and NoFlo</p> <p>After the introduction session, we\u2019ll move to an open hackfest. It will last as long as people hang around. We\u2019ll cover whatever there is interest for, but here are some ideas:</p> <p>- Expand the component library<br/>- Adding support for new boards/microcontrollers to MicroFlo<br/>- Hacking core MicroFlo, and Flowhub (the IDE)</p> <p>No prior knowledge of MicroFlo, NoFlo or Flowhub is required. Some prior experience with Arduino, microcontrollers or basic programming recommended.</p> <p>You need to bring:</p> <p>- A laptop with Linux/OSX/Windows.<br/>- (optional) Your own Arduino / microcontroller hardware</p> <p>We have 20 Arduino kits for loan from OpenTechSchool Berlin and Technologiestiftung Berlin.</p> <p>See you there!\ufeff</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly collaborative computational art event. It is free and open to all, regardless of age, gender, or previous experience. Please read the following description before you join! You will enjoy it more.</p> <p><b>What is this event?</b>\u00a0<br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>What is Creative Coding?</b><br/>Creative coding is the art of expressing oneself through the medium of computation. Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds. If you are creative and like a bit of challenge, this one is for you.\u00a0</p> <p><b>What this event is not.</b><br/>The Creative Code Jam is not a lesson, a contest or a conference.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer or other computational weapon of choice. Interesting books for inspiration, fancy hardware, quirky materials and snacks to share are also always a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Theme suggestion</b><br/>Please suggest a theme in the comments below. Themes can be random topics like \"cake\", \"resilience\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"make a computational version of a non-digital artpiece\", or anything you can think of really.</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>co.up coworking<br/>Adalbertstr. 8<br/>10999 Berlin</p> <p>The place is a bit hard to find.\u00a0<br/>This should help:\u00a0<a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\"><a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\" class=\"linkified\">http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking</a></a></p> <p>Co.up coworking is kindly providing the space.

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p><b>Agenda</b></p> <p><b>Talk/Demo\u00a0(ca. 15 mins)</b>: <b>Test Driven Development (short TDD)</b> is a big topic these days. Writing the test before implementing the functionality comes with decent benefits. The most obvious one of course is a good test coverage. But the short development cycle also helps to focus on what is important right now. Furthermore tests make it more easy to write good code because they enforce a thought-out structure and enable you to refactor without worrying about breaking something.\u00a0</p> <p>But how to get started with Test Driven Development? This session will demonstrate how to code a small program with tests first. The process can be applied easily to projects of all scale.</p> <p><b>Andreas</b> is technical lead at Moccu, a digital agency based in Berlin. His Background is building backend systems for websites and web applications with Python and Django. He also likes to tweak the agency's workflow with various tools and techniques. At OpenTechSchool Andreas is mainly engaged in the Python group where he coaches at workshops and contributes to the learning materials</p> <p>The main talk will be followed by <b>a short talk (ca. 5 mins)</b> from <b>Daniel Rios,</b> who learns Python with OTS, <b>about his experiences with TDD.<br/></b></p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 60 mins)</b></p> <p>- Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.

Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome and free to ask questions. Please note that there will be no formal talks and no lesson but many interesting people to talk to and get inspiration from.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer. Stuff to show if you can. Snacks are also a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>Co-up Coworking space<br/>Adalbertstr. 7-8<br/>(back of the compound, to the left, across from white mailboxes)</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/8/8/600_416428552.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>How much is it?</b><br/>Attending this event is free!

Please read the following description before you join! You will enjoy it more.</p> <p><b>What is this event?</b>\u00a0<br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time.

Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds.

Themes can be random topics like \"cake\", \"resilience\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"make a computational version of a non-digital artpiece\", or anything you can think of really.</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>co.up coworking<br/>Adalbertstr. 8<br/>10999 Berlin</p> <p>The place is a bit hard to find.\u00a0<br/>This should help:\u00a0<a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\"><a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\" class=\"linkified\">http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking</a></a></p> <p>Co.up coworking is kindly providing the space.

Through a set of so called metacharacters, regular expressions can be a very powerful tool. They are implemented in a lot of programming languages as well as many programs ranging from command line tools to office software, so they can be useful for almost everyone. This talk will give you an overview how regular expressions are used and shows the basics to get started.</p> <p><b>Andreas</b> is technical lead at Moccu, a digital agency based in Berlin. Most of the time he uses Python and Django to build backend systems for websites and web applications. He also likes to tweak the agency's workflow with various tools and techniques. At OpenTechSchool Andreas is mainly engaged in the Python group where he organizes workshops and contributes to the learning materials</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 60 mins)</b></p> <p>- Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs.

    "description": "<p><b>\"Why do I need a preprocessor?\"</b></p> <p>Preprocessors for CSS have become the industry standard and you'll be reading more and more about them all over the tech community. They're named LESS, Stylus or SASS. <b>Preprocessors make CSS more flexible, maintainable and fill in where CSS has its limits and drawbacks.</b> And the best thing is: you don't have to be a CSS pro to get started with SASS. If you know basic CSS then there is know reason to hold back in learning SASS.</p> <p>In this speech I want to show you how to install SASS on your machine, then get into the basics and most useful features it offers, later on I will show some live coding examples and dive into understandable advanced features to point out the potential and extensibility of a preprocessor.</p> <p><i>The goal is to motivate <a href=\"http://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/attendee.html\">a</a>ttendees to get going with a preprocessor to make everyones code lives easier.</i></p> <p><b><br/>Location</b></p> <p>The event will take place in conference room 4 &amp; 5 and offer space for about 70-80 people. Beer, Water and Mate will be sponsored by ImmobilienScout24.</p> <p><b>About the host</b></p> <p>My name is Ferdinand Vogler (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ferdinandvogler\">@ferdinandvogler</a>) and I'm a communication design student in fifth semester at HTW Berlin. I recently visited my first OpenTechSchool presentation and love the concept of OTS and would like to contribute to that.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly collaborative computational art event. It is free and open to all, regardless of age, gender, or previous experience. Please read the following description before you join! You will enjoy it more.</p> <p><b>What is this event?</b>\u00a0<br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>What is Creative Coding?</b><br/>Creative coding is the art of expressing oneself through the medium of computation. Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds. If you are creative and like a bit of challenge, this one is for you.\u00a0</p> <p><b>What this event is not.</b><br/>The Creative Code Jam is not a lesson, a contest or a conference.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer or other computational weapon of choice. Interesting books for inspiration, fancy hardware, quirky materials and snacks to share are also always a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Theme suggestion</b><br/>Please suggest a theme in the comments below. Themes can be random topics like \"cake\", \"resilience\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"make a computational version of a non-digital artpiece\", or anything you can think of really.</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>co.up coworking<br/>Adalbertstr. 8<br/>10999 Berlin</p> <p>The place is a bit hard to find.\u00a0<br/>This should help:\u00a0<a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\"><a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\" class=\"linkified\">http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking</a></a></p> <p>Co.up coworking is kindly providing the space.

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly collaborative computational art event. It is free and open to all, regardless of age, gender, or previous experience. Please read the following description before you join! You will enjoy it more.</p> <p><b>What is this event?</b>\u00a0<br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>What is Creative Coding?</b><br/>Creative coding is the art of expressing oneself through the medium of computation. Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds. If you are creative and like a bit of challenge, this one is for you.\u00a0</p> <p><b>What this event is not.</b><br/>The Creative Code Jam is not a lesson, a contest or a conference.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer or other computational weapon of choice. Interesting books for inspiration, fancy hardware, quirky materials and snacks to share are also always a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Theme suggestion</b><br/>Please suggest a theme in the comments below. Themes can be random topics like \"cake\", \"resilience\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"make a computational version of a non-digital artpiece\", or anything you can think of really.</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>co.up coworking<br/>Adalbertstr. 8<br/>10999 Berlin</p> <p>The place is a bit hard to find.\u00a0<br/>This should help:\u00a0<a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\"><a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\" class=\"linkified\">http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking</a></a></p> <p>Co.up coworking is kindly providing the space.

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly collaborative computational art event. It is free and open to all, regardless of age, gender, or previous experience. Please read the following description before you join! You will enjoy it more.</p> <p><b>What is this event?</b>\u00a0<br/>A relaxed (but intense) prototyping day. Participants are invited to form teams, improvise and create something together in a limited time. Asking questions throughout the day is encouraged!</p> <p><b>What is Creative Coding?</b><br/>Creative coding is the art of expressing oneself through the medium of computation. Creative coders often use tools like Processing, OpenFrameworks, Cinder, etc.</p> <p><b>Who is this event for?</b><br/>Artists (New Media or otherwise), technologists, designers, makers, and code enthusiasts of all kinds. If you are creative and like a bit of challenge, this one is for you.\u00a0</p> <p><b>What this event is not.</b><br/>The Creative Code Jam is not a lesson, a contest or a conference.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer or other computational weapon of choice. Interesting books for inspiration, fancy hardware, quirky materials and snacks to share are also always a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Theme suggestion</b><br/>Please suggest a theme in the comments below. Themes can be random topics like \"cake\", \"resilience\" or \"killer clowns\", creative constrains like \"make a computational version of a non-digital artpiece\", or anything you can think of really.</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>Co-up Coworking space<br/>Adalbertstr. 7-8<br/>(back of the compound, to the left, across from white mailboxes)</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/8/8/600_416428552.jpeg\" /></p> <p>&lt;a href=\"http://how.do/guide/get-to-coup-coworking\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>How much is it?</b><br/>Attending this event is free! Like all OpenTechSchool events. Co-up is kindly providing the space. If you feel grateful (we certainly do), you can thank them buying their drinks for \u20ac1.50!\u00a0</p> <p><b>Do I need to know German?</b><br/>Our events are in English.

    "description": "<p><b>A message from the team</b></p> <p>Dear creative coders,</p> <p>Our next Berlin meetup \u2014 the fifteenth Creative Coding Stammtisch \u2014 is coming up this Friday night at co.up. It is is a friendly gathering of artists, designers, students, academics, researchers and anyone interested in the use of technology as a medium. It\u2019s a place to grow and share your passion for generative design, new media, net.art, etc. Everyone is welcome and free to present a project, propose a topic for discussion or even sit back and enjoy the conversation.</p> <p>But we are not (only) writing to promote our event. The main reason we're putting this down is because up to now \u2014 we're ashamed to admit \u2014 our meetups have suffered from a gender bias not reflecting what we know to be the real diversity of the Art and Technology scene of Berlin.</p> <p>As members of Open Tech School as well as individually, our team has always been committed to supporting diversity. But it's not enough to be well-meaning and we've come to realize we need to be more vocal about what we stand for. We can do better and, from today on, we are going to.</p> <p>We want people of any gender, origin, belief system, sexual orientation or knowledge level to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are reaching out to female artists/designers/theorists/students/learners to let you know that you DO belong and are part of it. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard.</p> <p>Wether you consider yourself to be a beginner or an expert, a theorist or a practicing artist/technologist, we invite you to join us on Friday, ask questions if you want, contribute with your comments and maybe show a project you're working on. Together, we can make our gatherings the diverse and supportive network they were always meant to be.</p> <p>Ps: Though the main focus of this post is to address the gender bias, it goes without saying that our invitation extends to anyone who feels underrepresented in Art &amp; Tech events.</p> <p>The Creative Code Berlin team<br/><i>Rapha\u00ebl de Courville<br/>Rachel Uwa<br/>Abe Pazos<br/>Ramin Soleymani</i></p> <p><b>--</b></p> <p><b>Creative Code Stammtisch</b></p> <p>is a friendly gathering of creative people who like to work with programs such as Processing, openFrameworks, SuperCollider, Pure Data, vvvv, Arduino, Cinder, etc. The atmosphere is relaxed. There is usually a time for people to present something if they want to, followed by informal discussions.</p> <p><b>The event is free and open</b> to artists, designers, and code enthusiasts, regardless of age, gender or experience. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome and free to ask questions. Please note that there will be no formal talks and no lesson but many interesting people to talk to and get inspiration from.</p> <p><b>What should I bring?</b><br/>Bring your computer. Stuff to show if you can. Snacks are also a good idea :)</p> <p><b>Where is it?</b><br/>Co-up Coworking space<br/>Adalbertstr. 7-8<br/>(back of the compound, to the left, across from white mailboxes)</p> <p><img src=\"http://photos3.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/f/8/8/600_416428552.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>How much is it?</b><br/>Attending this event is free, like all OpenTechSchool events! Co-up is kindly providing the space. If you feel grateful (we certainly do), you can thank them buying their drinks for \u20ac1.50!\u00a0</p> <p><b>Do I need to know German?</b><br/>Our events are in English. International guests are more than welcome!</p> <p><b>See you there!</b></p>",

We will have opportunities during the evening to share what we learned, ask questions and share resources, however, this is not going to be a formal workshop where coaches guide the process.</p> <p>If this sounds like your thing, sign up here and we will keep you updated! :-)</p>",

The jam is an opportunity to meet likeminded people and get creative together in a relaxed and safe environment.\u00a0</p> <p>Creations can range from\u00a0live visuals and custom VJing tools to visual art and generative design, art installations, net.art, interactive art, projection mapping, sound art and much more.</p> <p>Our focus is on\u00a0collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation, so\u00a0making mistakes is not only okay, it's actually encouraged!</p> <p>And you don't need to be a coder yourself! We are all about the intersection of disciplines so let us repeat this:\u00a0<b>this\u00a0event is NOT just for coders!</b>\u00a0:) If you think you might enjoy building machines that make art, you will\u00a0have fun!</p> <p>If you're just getting started, the following video\u00a0gives a rather comprehensive overview of what creative coding can look like:\u00a0<a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\"><a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\" class=\"linkified\">http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/</a></a></p> <p>During the jam, participants from various backgrounds are encouraged to team up and produce new work together. We also often propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees. If there is interest, we may give short a introduction on a topic related to creative coding.\u00a0The format is open so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know!

Come and hear short presentations from some members of this intake, and ask learners and coaches any questions you might have about the initiative!\u00a0During Hackership there are workshops, presentations and weekly demos very similar to this nights format.\u00a0So come and hear what some current learners at Hackership have been upto the last 9 weeks, Or even better, present something yourself.</p> <p>And, if you are interested in attending Hackership in Berlin this Summer or Costa Rica this September, it will also be your chance to speak to one of the volunteers and alumni from this initiative and learn more. \u00a0</p> <p><b>Demo yourself too!</b></p> <p>\u00a0Are you building something awesome right now that you want to share or need feedback on? \u00a0In the spirit of Hack n\u2019Tell Berlin, we will have an open forum for short presentations of cool hacks and projects.\u00a0We'll give you 5 minutes to show off your tool, hack, library (did you just write a library to access the Meetup API in Go!?), whatever. We're language and software/hardware agnostic, so it's all fair game.</p> <p>After you present, it's an open forum. The audience will ask questions and provide feedback.</p> <p>There is no limit to the kind of hacks that can be presented. Demo cool stuff, no matter if it's a mobile app, website, desktop program or library. Anything is allowed, just cross the line to awesomeness - and if it fails it should do it beautifully.</p> <p>Here\u2019s how it works:</p> <p>\u2022 You'll get 5 minutes to present in English</p> <p>\u2022 You or your team should have built it yourself</p> <p>\u2022 People can ask you questions afterwards</p> <p>\u2022 NO PURE SLIDEDECKS, no pitches, only demos + code</p> <p>\u2022 Show us code!!! (reasonable exemptions may be possible)</p> <p>\u2022 Entertain us!</p> <p>\u2022 You only show us projects you developed.\u00a0</p> <p>We hope you can make it and demo something you are working on. As ever, the focus is on sharing and learning, so don\u2019t be shy!</p> <p>Note, If you are thinking of demo-ing, please send a message via Meetup, just so we have an idea of numbers.</p> <p>Peace, love and curiosity. &lt;3</p> <p>*Thanks to HacknTell Berlin for their great outline. The rules and structure of the night as described here are taken from their page.\u00a0</p>",

This is why we are specifically reaching out to female artists, designers, theorists, students and learners. We want you to know that this community belongs to YOU. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard. This invitation extends, of course, to everyone who feels underrepresented at art &amp; tech events.</p> <p><b>SAFE SPACE POLICY</b><br/>Our events are free\u00a0and\u00a0open to everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, social situation and religion (or lack thereof).

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly gathering of artists, makers, designers, illustrators, coders, musicians, performers, learners and\u00a0anyone interested in<b> the use of computing skills for artistic expression</b>.\u00a0Creations can range from\u00a0live visuals and custom VJing tools to visual art and generative design, art installations, net.art, interactive art, projection mapping, sound art and much more.</p> <p>The jam is an opportunity to meet likeminded people and get creative together in a relaxed and safe environment.\u00a0</p> <p>Wether you consider yourself to be a beginner or a practicing artist/designer/technologist... we invite you to join us on Saturday and see for yourself.</p> <p>If you're just getting started, the following video\u00a0gives a rather comprehensive overview of what creative coding can look like:\u00a0<a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\"><a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\" class=\"linkified\">http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/</a></a>\u00a0</p> <p>Note that you don't need to be a coder yourself! We are all about the intersection of disciplines so let us repeat this: <b>this event is NOT just for coders!</b> If you dig media art, you will enjoy yourself, and maybe even learn something! I\u2019m not gonna lie: many of us like to write code, but we try to keep our geeky side in check :)</p> <p>Shout random words at us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P5Jam\">@P5Jam</a></p> <p><b>SO WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?</b>\u00a0<br/>During the jam, participants from various backgrounds are encouraged to team up and produce new work together.\u00a0Our focus is on\u00a0collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation, so\u00a0making mistakes is not only okay, it's actually encouraged!</p> <p>We also often propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees.</p> <p>The format is open and we like to keep it experimental so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know! If it fits, we will make it happen :)\u00a0</p> <p><b>A NOTE ON DIVERSITY\u00a0</b><br/>As members of Open Tech School and as individuals, our team is committed to embracing diversity. We want everyone to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are specifically reaching out to female artists, designers, theorists, students and learners. We want you to know that this community belongs to YOU. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard. This invitation extends, of course, to everyone who feels underrepresented at art &amp; tech events.</p> <p><b>SAFE SPACE POLICY<br/></b>Our events are free\u00a0and\u00a0open to everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, social situation and religion (or lack thereof). We are\u00a0dedicated to providing a harassment-free creative space where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves. We expect you to respect and contribute to this environment.</p> <p>We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:\u00a0<br/><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\"><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></a>\u00a0<br/>Please make sure you agree with its content.</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/SableRaf/CCBerlin/tree/master/SafeSpacePolicy\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>ACCESSIBILITY</b>\u00a0<br/>Co.up rooms are located on the third and fifth floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those who need it. Please let us know how we can make the space more accessible and your visit more comfortable!</p> <p><b>DO I NEED TO SPEAK GERMAN?\u00a0<br/></b>We speak mostly English so international guests are more than welcome!

    "description": "<p>Dear creatives. This Saturday the Berlin Science Hackers will join us at co.up for a combined lab/jam. It is a young meetup group(<a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Science-Hacking/\"><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Science-Hacking/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Science-Hacking/</a></a>), which originated from the Science Hack Day (<a href=\"http://berlin.sciencehackday.org/\"><a href=\"http://berlin.sciencehackday.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://berlin.sciencehackday.org/</a></a>).Their Science Hack Lab has a similar format to our jam and since it happens that it falls to the very same date this month we thought it would be nice to blend them together. So nothing of our jam format will change. There might only be some people, which will throw in some science related themes/ hack ideas- think of slime, popcorn or something- \u00a0everything like usual.</p> <p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly gathering of artists, makers, designers, illustrators, coders, musicians, performers, learners and\u00a0anyone interested in<b> the use of computing skills for artistic expression</b>.\u00a0Creations can range from\u00a0live visuals and custom VJing tools to visual art and generative design, art installations, net.art, interactive art, projection mapping, sound art and much more.</p> <p>The jam is an opportunity to meet likeminded people and get creative together in a relaxed and safe environment.\u00a0</p> <p>Wether you consider yourself to be a beginner or a practicing artist/designer/technologist... we invite you to join us on Saturday and see for yourself.</p> <p>If you're just getting started, the following video\u00a0gives a rather comprehensive overview of what creative coding can look like:\u00a0<a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\"><a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\" class=\"linkified\">http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/</a></a>\u00a0</p> <p>Note that you don't need to be a coder yourself! We are all about the intersection of disciplines so let us repeat this: <b>this event is NOT just for coders!</b> If you dig media art, you will enjoy yourself, and maybe even learn something! I\u2019m not gonna lie: many of us like to write code, but we try to keep our geeky side in check :)</p> <p>Shout random words at us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P5Jam\">@P5Jam</a></p> <p><b>SO WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?</b>\u00a0<br/>During the jam, participants from various backgrounds are encouraged to team up and produce new work together.\u00a0Our focus is on\u00a0collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation, so\u00a0making mistakes is not only okay, it's actually encouraged!</p> <p>We also often propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees.</p> <p>The format is open and we like to keep it experimental so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know! If it fits, we will make it happen :)\u00a0</p> <p><b>A NOTE ON DIVERSITY\u00a0</b><br/>As members of Open Tech School and as individuals, our team is committed to embracing diversity. We want everyone to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are specifically reaching out to female artists, designers, theorists, students and learners. We want you to know that this community belongs to YOU. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard. This invitation extends, of course, to everyone who feels underrepresented at art &amp; tech events.</p> <p><b>SAFE SPACE POLICY<br/></b>Our events are free\u00a0and\u00a0open to everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, social situation and religion (or lack thereof). We are\u00a0dedicated to providing a harassment-free creative space where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves. We expect you to respect and contribute to this environment.</p> <p>We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:\u00a0<br/><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\"><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></a>\u00a0<br/>Please make sure you agree with its content.</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/SableRaf/CCBerlin/tree/master/SafeSpacePolicy\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>ACCESSIBILITY</b>\u00a0<br/>Co.up rooms are located on the third and fifth floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those who need it. Please let us know how we can make the space more accessible and your visit more comfortable!</p> <p><b>DO I NEED TO SPEAK GERMAN?\u00a0<br/></b>We speak mostly English so international guests are more than welcome! Our team also speaks French, Italian, Spanish, Finnish and German... Language availability may vary depending on which organizers are present :)\u00a0</p> <p><b>WHERE IS IT?\u00a0<br/></b>Co-up Coworking space\u00a0Adalbertstr. 7-8\u00a0<br/>(back of the compound, to the left, across from white mailboxes)\u00a0</p> <p>The gate is closed?\u00a0Call:\u00a0+49 151 7537 4602</p> <p><i>Note: Our friends at Co.up coworking are letting us use their space for free.

We are all about the intersection of disciplines so let us repeat this: <b>this event is NOT just for coders!</b> If you dig media art, you will enjoy yourself, and maybe even learn something! I\u2019m not gonna lie: many of us like to write code, but we try to keep our geeky side in check :)</p> <p>Shout random words at us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P5Jam\">@P5Jam</a></p> <p><b>SO WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?</b>\u00a0<br/>During the jam, participants from various backgrounds are encouraged to team up and produce new work together.\u00a0Our focus is on\u00a0collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation, so\u00a0making mistakes is not only okay, it's actually encouraged!</p> <p>We also often propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees.</p> <p>The format is open and we like to keep it experimental so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know! If it fits, we will make it happen :)\u00a0</p> <p><b>A NOTE ON DIVERSITY\u00a0</b><br/>As members of Open Tech School and as individuals, our team is committed to embracing diversity. We want everyone to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are specifically reaching out to female artists, designers, theorists, students and learners. We want you to know that this community belongs to YOU. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard. This invitation extends, of course, to everyone who feels underrepresented at art &amp; tech events.</p> <p><b>SAFE SPACE POLICY<br/></b>Our events are free\u00a0and\u00a0open to everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, social situation and religion (or lack thereof).

What are package management systems and what are they good for?\u00a0</b></p> <p>Installing software is easy. Just tell your app-store or package management system what you want and it will download, install and update the software for you. But it has not always been like that and sometimes it can be confusing. In this talk you will learn how package management systems work, how they became a thing, what this had to do with Free/Libre Open Source Software and how to use one on Debian or Ubuntu Linux.</p> <p><b>Nicolai von Neudeck</b> works as a system administrator at the Humboldt-University where he also studies Cultural Anthropology. He likes franco-belgian comics, cyborgs and repairing things. At OpenTechSchool he helps run the Learners Meetup and has coached at an \"Opening Hardware\" workshop.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 60 mins)</b></p> <p>- Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar.

    "description": "<p>The Creative Code Jam is a monthly gathering of artists, makers, designers, illustrators, coders, musicians, performers, learners and\u00a0anyone interested in<b> the use of computing skills for artistic expression</b>.\u00a0Creations can range from\u00a0live visuals and custom VJing tools to visual art and generative design, art installations, net.art, interactive art, projection mapping, sound art and much more.</p> <p>The jam is an opportunity to meet likeminded people and get creative together in a relaxed and safe environment.\u00a0</p> <p>Wether you consider yourself to be a beginner or a practicing artist/designer/technologist... we invite you to join us on Saturday and see for yourself.</p> <p>If you're just getting started, the following video\u00a0gives a rather comprehensive overview of what creative coding can look like:\u00a0<a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\"><a href=\"http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/\" class=\"linkified\">http://video.pbs.org/video/2322911761/</a></a>\u00a0</p> <p>Note that you don't need to be a coder yourself! We are all about the intersection of disciplines so let us repeat this: <b>this event is NOT just for coders!</b> If you dig media art, you will enjoy yourself, and maybe even learn something! I\u2019m not gonna lie: many of us like to write code, but we try to keep our geeky side in check :)</p> <p>Shout random words at us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P5Jam\">@P5Jam</a></p> <p><b>SO WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?</b>\u00a0<br/>During the jam, participants from various backgrounds are encouraged to team up and produce new work together.\u00a0Our focus is on\u00a0collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation, so\u00a0making mistakes is not only okay, it's actually encouraged!</p> <p>We also often propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees.</p> <p>The format is open and we like to keep it experimental so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know! If it fits, we will make it happen :)\u00a0</p> <p><b>A NOTE ON DIVERSITY\u00a0</b><br/>As members of Open Tech School and as individuals, our team is committed to embracing diversity. We want everyone to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are specifically reaching out to female artists, designers, theorists, students and learners. We want you to know that this community belongs to YOU. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard. This invitation extends, of course, to everyone who feels underrepresented at art &amp; tech events.</p> <p><b>SAFE SPACE POLICY<br/></b>Our events are free\u00a0and\u00a0open to everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, social situation and religion (or lack thereof). We are\u00a0dedicated to providing a harassment-free creative space where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves. We expect you to respect and contribute to this environment.</p> <p>We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:\u00a0<br/><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\"><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></a>\u00a0<br/>Please make sure you agree with its content.</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/SableRaf/CCBerlin/tree/master/SafeSpacePolicy\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>ACCESSIBILITY</b>\u00a0<br/>Co.up rooms are located on the third and fifth floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those who need it. Please let us know how we can make the space more accessible and your visit more comfortable!</p> <p><b>DO I NEED TO SPEAK GERMAN?\u00a0<br/></b>We speak mostly English so international guests are more than welcome!

We are all about the intersection of disciplines so let us repeat this: <b>this event is NOT just for coders!</b> If you dig media art, you will enjoy yourself, and maybe even learn something! I\u2019m not gonna lie: many of us like to write code, but we try to keep our geeky side in check :)</p> <p>Shout random words at us on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/P5Jam\">@P5Jam</a></p> <p><b>SO WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?</b>\u00a0<br/>During the jam, participants from various backgrounds are encouraged to team up and produce new work together.\u00a0Our focus is on\u00a0collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation, so\u00a0making mistakes is not only okay, it's actually encouraged!</p> <p>We also often propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees.</p> <p>The format is open and we like to keep it experimental so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know! If it fits, we will make it happen :)\u00a0</p> <p><b>A NOTE ON DIVERSITY\u00a0</b><br/>As members of Open Tech School and as individuals, our team is committed to embracing diversity. We want everyone to feel welcome and supported. This is why we are specifically reaching out to female artists, designers, theorists, students and learners. We want you to know that this community belongs to YOU. We wish for a diversity of opinions to be represented and we will go out of our way to make the largest possible range of voices heard. This invitation extends, of course, to everyone who feels underrepresented at art &amp; tech events.</p> <p><b>SAFE SPACE POLICY<br/></b>Our events are free\u00a0and\u00a0open to everyone, regardless of their gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, social situation and religion (or lack thereof). We are\u00a0dedicated to providing a harassment-free creative space where everyone feels comfortable expressing themselves. We expect you to respect and contribute to this environment.</p> <p>We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:\u00a0<br/><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\"><a href=\"https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">https://rubyberlin.github.io/code-of-conduct/</a></a>\u00a0<br/>Please make sure you agree with its content.</p> <p>&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/SableRaf/CCBerlin/tree/master/SafeSpacePolicy\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p> <p><b>ACCESSIBILITY</b>\u00a0<br/>Co.up rooms are located on the third and fifth floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those who need it.

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p><b>Talk (ca. 20 mins)</b><b>: Intro to A/B Testing: Experimenting with product ideas the \u201eMad Scientist\" way</b></p> <p>Most major online platforms these days run A/B tests. A lot of them. From entire features to the wording in e-mails, almost everything gets A/B tested.</p> <p>The idea is simple: If you have a large enough user base, you can roll out two or more different versions of your feature, design or wording to different parts of your user base, and see which one is more successful. This is called \u201eexperimentation\u201c on your user base, the same way pharmaceutical companies run trials of medicine before they sell them to the whole population.</p> <p>The proper implementation of an online A/B test is kind of tricky, however. This talk introduces the coding, process and statistical aspects of how to create A/B tests for your own features (or e-mail wording!).</p> <p><b>Ellen</b> is a data applications engineer @ SoundCloud and aspiring social psychologist. She is is deeply fascinated by all sorts of data and\u00a0code\u00a0related topics such as data analysis, data hacking,\u00a0code\u00a0quality, tech culture and the implications of information technology for our future daily lives. She also enjoys sharing her favorite interests with others, by speaking at conferences and meetups, organizing meetups for OpenTechSchool and coaching in workshops.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>- Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar. Looking forward to see you!</p> <p><b>Ideas/questions?</b> Email us at team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</p>",

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p><b>Talk (ca. 20 mins): \"Intro to orchestration: Reproduceable and self-documenting computer configuration.\"</b></p> <p>Configuring computers properly is a lot of work. Doing it on several machines is even more tedious. And remembering what exactly one did five weeks later is next to impossible. And of course one tends to not document properly what one did because doing it was already more than enough labour. Do not even mention sharing the configuring you did with others.<br/>Orchestration promises to change all that for the better and it mostly does. The talk will quickly show why orchestration is a thing, what it promises and what it actually does. There will be a small live-demo with an easy to use orchestration tool called Ansible.</p> <p><b>Nicolai</b> is a cultural anthropologist who works in a small start up where he mostly configures computers. He likes franco-belgian comic-books and is interested in way too many things, among them cultural and material implications of tech.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar. Looking forward to see you!</p> <p><b>Ideas/questions?</b> Email us at team.beginners-meetup@opentechschool.org</p>",

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p><b>Talk (ca. 20 mins) A simple intro to machine learning for the curious but scared<br/></b></p> <p>Machine learning is a hot topic right now, that many people (including myself) get excited about. It is also notoriously confusing to get into unless you got started on this in uni already. There seems to be this impenetrable forrest of statistics-heavy textbooks, obscure mathematical optimization techniques and fancy buzzwords that I personally cannot even get really fascinated with, let alone digest in my spare time.<br/>Despite my background in computer science, it took me many false starts to get even a bit of a hold of this topic. In my talk I want to summarize the very basic ideas that often get left out of other \u201eIntroductions\u201c to the topic that I wish someone had told me a few years ago. I will cover what it actually means when a machine \u201elearns\u201c, a high level overview of \u201ehow\u201c machines can learn, and some pointers to friendly resources that can get you started.\u00a0</p> <p><b>by Ellen K\u00f6nig</b>\u00a0- Ellen works as an \u201eA/B testing\" engineer at SoundCloud, somewhere on the intersection of programming and applied statistics. She has an academic background in Computer Science, and a largely self-taught background in stats and ML. She also loves to learn to dance and all sorts of other organized and self-taught learning opportunities on a wide range of topics. \u00a0</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar.

    "description": "<p>We are very happy to announce the organisation of the very first RustBridge here in Berlin: a hands-on workshop to learn Rust. As part of RustFest taking place that weekend, the OpenTechSchool Berlin is organising a beta-run of a beginners workshop to learn Rust on Sunday, September 18th, 2016 at Co-Up.</p> <p><b> What is<a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\"> Rust</a> ? </b></p> <p>Rust is a new, safe systems programming language developed primarily by Mozilla. Systems programming? You might have heard of C/C++ as languages to built low-level and super fast programs with. Rust plays in the same league but as a very young language is from the ground up designed to deal with concurrent multi-processing environments (like multi-core CPUs). Further more it provides new mechanism to improve \"safety\" of your programs memory, the primary reason why C/C++ are considered hard and that high level languages like Python, Ruby and Javascript handle for you with a high performance penalty.</p> <p>Or to say it with the claim from <a href=\"https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/\">rust-lang.org</a>:<i> \"Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.\"</i></p> <p><b>What is RustBridge? </b></p> <p>In the traditions of <a href=\"http://railsbridge.org/\">RailsBridge</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/rust-community/rustbridge\">RustBridge</a> is a community initiative to develop a workshop to teach absolute beginners about programming using Rust. This will be its very first trial workshop. Therefore the material might be a little rough and not super polished yet: feedback is very welcome!</p> <p>We are currently aiming for two distinct workshops to work through on your own. While one aims to be suitable for beginners the other is already a bit more challenging and will bring you deeper into more advanced rust topics. Though the format eventually aims to be suitable for total beginners, for this edition we require that you have some essential programming experience. It's still a beta!</p> <p>This event is organised in collaboration and as part of RustFest \u2013 a\u00a0 community conference dedicated to the Rust Programming language taking place on the very same weekend of September 17th/18th. You can learn more (and get ticket) at <a href=\"http://www.rustfest.eu\">RustFest.EU</a>.</p> <p><b><a href=\"http://discourse.opentechschool.org/t/rustbridge-workshop-sept-18th-berlin-together-with-rustfest/1849\">All Requirements, details and sign up over on the community forum</a></b>.</p>",

But all this abstraction has made us forget what the core of a computer really is. What are registers? Latches? Stacks? Frame pointers? Conditional jumps? Computers can seem quirky at times, and occasionally even resemble black magic. Dive into the core of a computer, however, and the high-level puzzle pieces can finally click together. This talk will show how you could build a simple computer from scratch, and explain all core concepts along the way.</p> <p><b>by Denis Defreyne</b>\u00a0- Denis Defreyne is a software engineer at SoundCloud, where he has built large parts of the On SoundCloud monetisation programme, and is now member of the core engineering team. In his spare time, he often indulges in his obsession for electronic music, plays around with exciting new technologies, and chases cats.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar.

But if we manage to stick to them, they reveal themselves as some sort of miracle cure for our collaboration and product success.\u00a0I would like to shed the light of a psychologist on why that is and pass some reasons on to you to persevere.

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p><b>Talk (ca. 20 mins)\u00a0Naming Things</b></p> <p>Code is meant to be read by people much more than by computers. When we write code, we should have the reader in mind.<br/>You might have heard \"There are two hard things in computer science: Cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-one errors\". There is some truth to that. But with a few simple guidelines in mind you can make your life as someone who has to do with software development much easier.<br/>The talk will start out by illustrating why it\u2019s good to name things well. It will then tell you a little bit about how to inform the reader of your code about what is hidden behind variable, class and method names.<br/>By the end of the talk, you should find naming a lot easier for many common cases.</p> <p><b>by Martin Meyerhoff</b> -\u00a0Martin Meyerhoff is a political scientist, ruby developer and CEO of a company that works\u00a0with the open source e-commerce framework Solidus.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>We usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar.

I'd like to discuss Unicode in its context: why it came to be, how it works and what its advantages and flaws are.</p> <p>You will leave this talk with the most important basics about Unicode: when to care about it, what and what not to care about and basic vocabulary to competently speak about it.\u00a0</p> <p><b>by Florian Gilcher</b> -\u00a0Florian Gilcher is an active Rubyist and Rustacean.

Ask different people and you will get different answers. The Product Manager is a \"jack of all trades\" (someone who does... well, everything). Some call them the \"mini-CEO\". Or the \"defender of the customer\". So... what does a Product Manager actually do? And why do we need them? Shaun found his own answer to this question. He will attempt to clear up the confusion by sharing his story as a Product Manager, the lessons he learnt along the way, and how he now thinks differently about his job, 5 years on.</p> <p><b>by Shaun Russell</b> -Shaun is a Product Manager at Outfittery, a personal shopping service based in Berlin. His previous experience includes London-based fashion retailer Lyst, and Adthena, a search intelligence tool.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs.

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p><b>Talk (ca. 20 mins) Intro to Databases and SQL</b></p> <p>Relational databases provide reliable and efficient data storage since several decades. Though NoSQL technologies are getting widely used in some applications recently and might be a great choice, having relational database management systems and SQL in the tool-box still remains a must for any senior developer, data engineer or data scientist. In this talk, I will start with the philosophical question how we transfer data to knowledge and give a short introduction or what relational and no-SQL databases actually are.</p> <p><b>by Ilya Vladimirskiy</b> -\u00a0Ilya studied mathematics in Moscow, did computer science research in Marburg and worked as a database developer, data engineer, and consultant. He currently works as product owner at Smartfrog, an IoT startup based in Berlin. His previous experience includes fashion platform Zalando and match-making service eDarling.</p> <p><b>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</b></p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>Afterwards we usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar. Looking forward to see you!</p> <p><b>Ideas/questions?</b> Reach out to us on\u00a0<a href=\"http://discourse.opentechschool.org/\" class=\"linkified\">http://discourse.opentechschool.org/</a></p>",

For the agenda, click on \u201eRead more\u201c.</p> <p>Talk (ca. 20 mins) *What\u2019s going on? Monitoring, Instrumentation and Metrics*</p> <p>When running software one is often a bit clueless what is actually happening. Say the computer\u2019s CPUs are at 80%: Is something broken and slowing down other parts? Or is everything running smoothly and we are just making good use of resources?<br/>And what are your users actually doing? With metrics and instrumentation we can investigate how our software and systems behave while they run.<br/>In this introduction you will be taught a few basics of monitoring, get an idea of what can be done with it and see some examples of a monitoring toolkit called Prometheus.</p> <p>by *Nicolai von Neudeck* - Nicolai does DevOps for a living, studied cultural anthropology (californian computing, science and technology studies, populism, comics, antisemitism) and likes recumbent bicycles.</p> <p>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs. At the end we share what we discussed.</p> <p>Afterwards we usually continue our discussions with a drink in a nearby bar. Looking forward to see you!</p> <p>Ideas/questions?

When we write code, we are also solving a problem. This talk is about how to make your code reflect the concepts you are using to solve your problem, i.e. how to do an 'abstraction layer.' When you succeed at writing an abstraction layer, your code becomes simpler and easier to read.</p> <p>by *Christian Clampitt* - Christian was born in Denver, Colorado USA. He is a developer at Liefery and enjoys coding and painting.</p> <p>A mini barcamp! (ca. 40 mins)</p> <p>Anyone is invited to propose a topic they want to discuss or get help with and we organise ourselves into groups or pairs.

For example check out some of our OpenTechSchool workshop material:</p> <p>JavaScript for Beginners 1 (<a href=\"http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-1/\" class=\"linkified\">http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-1/</a>) | JavaScript for Beginners 2 (<a href=\"http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-2/\" class=\"linkified\">http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-2/</a>) | Intro to HTML/CSS (<a href=\"http://cssclass.es/materials/\" class=\"linkified\">http://cssclass.es/materials/</a>)</p> <p>We speak German and English, sometimes even Italian, and of course code. Just come by and check it out! Oh, and bring some snacks, maybe ;)</p> <p>You're also welcome to join our chat on Gitter (<a href=\"https://gitter.im/OpenTechSchool/BLN-WFColearning\" class=\"linkified\">https://gitter.im/OpenTechSchool/BLN-WFColearning</a>).</p> <p>We do have a code of conduct (<a href=\"http://www.opentechschool.org/code-of-conduct/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.opentechschool.org/code-of-conduct/</a>).</p>",
